# Blackjack CLI Python program
I originally programmed this game in January 2022 for the purpose of implementing the logic of the game before adding in the Tkinter GUI to create graphics that would simulate more of a real game. The game with the Tkinter GUI I am unable to share at the moment as it is being used in a study testing decision making.

This CLI version gives players a starting amount of $5000 in the bank to bet. Players get the option to hit, stand, and double down on their first hand. Then, the option to hit or stand for each consecutive hand. When applicable, players get the option to split on their first hand.

Hope this is helpful for those creating their own game!
